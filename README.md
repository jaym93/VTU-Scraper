# VTU-Scraper
### __An easy tool to extract your students' results from results.vtu.ac.in to your database__

## The audience
This tool is written with colleges in mind, because we noticed our lab guy one day toilng long hours copy-pasting every person's result into a spreadsheet. "BeautifulSoup",we thought. And the process became easier, the lab guy could spend time on life than in front of a computer.

## What is included
A simple database schema, and Python 3 code to pull the results of a set of USNs present in the database, for now. Run it judiciously, you will not have much luck if you run it the moment the results are announced. We recommend using it when the network is a bit less clogged, a couple of days after the results.

## In future...
This might evolve into a full fledged results retrieval and analysis system, keep an eye out, feel free to contribute!
